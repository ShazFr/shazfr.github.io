### Development
- Cyberbird is a hoverboard simulator made with synthwave aesthetic 
- It was made in 2 days for the GMTK gamejam 2021
- Four people were involved in the project
- I was responsible for the programming, we had a voice actor, a 3D artist and a Sound designer. 
- The Game is playable on a windows PC: <iframe frameborder="0" class = "flex flex-col max-w-full mt-0 prose dark:prose-invert lg:flex-row" src="https://itch.io/embed/1086296?dark=true" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://theawesomeshaz.itch.io/cyberbird">Cyberbird by TheAwesomeShaz</a></iframe>

### Gameplay
- Gameplay includes moving on a hoverboard and deflecting bullets
- There is a second camera on your bird which can scout ahead
- The bird can teleport the player to higher platforms
- This was very ambitious for 2 days and hence has some bugs<br><br>

### Stuff learned
- Never overscope a project
- Managing people takes a lot of time, communication is a skill
- Learned How to create a ragdoll in Unity, fade music dynamically
- Also learned how to transition between cinemachine cameras
- Take breaks when required, the crunch is not worth it.
- A smaller complete project is always better than a bigger project with bugs

### Lore
- At this point I had experience with Unity but had never worked in a team
- I was working at a job where I made hypercasual games
- Cyberpunk and synthwave was really popular (still is) back then
- I decided to make in the synthwave aesthetic but with random people
- The sound designer was form spain
- The 3D artist was from Singapore
- The Voice Actor was from Dubai
- Here I realized that timezones can cause a problem as well -->
