### Development
- Parkour System made in Unity using a character controller and root motion
- It is a thing I have been working on the side
- Programming: C#
- Game Engine: Unity

### Stuff learned
- Hierarchial State Machine pattern
- How to create own camera system without cinemachine
- How to use animator without any transitions
- How to transition animations only through code
- State Pattern and Observer Pattern
- Learned how to organize code since this project has been refactored 3 times by now
<!-- - Devlog / Making of Parkour System : {{< youtube uXinhbMsiaU>}} -->



<!-- ### Lore
- This is an ongoing project, I plan on improving it further once I get time (probably)
- This was being worked on whenever I got time after my job hours
- I had stopped working on this after the third refactor since I lost all interest by that point
- I had extensively played and researched Assassin's Creed's parkour system to make this -->
