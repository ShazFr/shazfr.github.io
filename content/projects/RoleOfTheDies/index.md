### Development
- Role of the Dies is an isometric puzzle game where the player enters the exit portal in all dimensions
- It was made for the GMTK gamejam 2022.
- It was a solo project, I did the programming, music and used free 3D assets
- Programming: C#
- Game Engine: Unity
- Music: FLStudio

### Gameplay
- Moving the cube accross the map and collecting knives
- These knives can be used to kill the spheres which shoot projectiles
- Projectiles from the spheres can kill the player
- After a random amount of time the dimension shifts
- This causes a reset in the level, layout, color scheme and music.
- The music remains the same but the instruments change giving a sense of familiarity
- The main Objective of the game is reach the portals in each dimension
- It is a downloadable game for Windows PC : <iframe frameborder="0" class = "flex flex-col max-w-full mt-0 prose dark:prose-invert lg:flex-row" src="https://itch.io/embed/1622097?dark=true" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://theawesomeshaz.itch.io/role-of-a-dies">ROLE OF A DIES by TheAwesomeShaz</a></iframe>


### Stuff learned

- Built in input system is good for prototyping since it is easier to work with

<!-- ### Lore
- At this point I was in between a job switch and graduating at the same time.
- This left me with some free time and I decided to learn from my previous mistakes and keep the game within scope
- This led to me using abstract art for the game, and focus on my strong areas programming and music
- Although the music isn't that great it still works for the short amount of time I had while making the game
- There was still a little crunch before releasing this, I need to improve my game scoping skills -->
